#  TextLink

The TextLink component finds words inside of a string, marks it as underlined and uses a delegate to manage where the user taps. LinkedWord param can be provided with matchIndex to identify which word, in case of repeated words inside the string, is the link. If matchIndex isn't provided TextLink component will underline the first match.
