# Fonts

By default mistica uses the system font, but it can be overriden with the Telef√≥nica ones:

- [OnAir](https://brandfactory.telefonica.com/document/2372#/nuestra-identidad/tipografia)
- [Telefonica](https://brandfactory.telefonica.com/document/483#/nuestra-identidad-new/tipografia)

## How to override the default font

1. Download the fonts from the links above. OTF fonts are preferred, and we only need three weights: light, regular and medium.
2. Add all three font files to your app Resources and make sure that they are added to your app target.
3. Include them in your app plist under the key `Fonts provided by application`. Inside you need to specify all three font files, for example: `Telefonica-Light.otf`, `Telefonica-Regular.otf` and `Telefonica-Medium.otf`.
4. Configure the Mistica framework to use this font. In your app delegate or in other place before any view is created, setup the `fontNameForWeight` property:

```swift
FontStyle.fontNameForWeight = { weight in
    switch weight {
    case .light, .ultraLight, .thin:
        return "Telefonica-Light"
    case .regular:
        return "Telefonica-Regular"
    case .medium, .bold, .semibold, .black, .heavy:
        return "Telefonica-Bold"
    default:
        return "Telefonica-Regular"
    }
}
```

Currently only light, regular and medium weights are used, but it could change in the future.
