# Tag

This view consists of a label to display text with a defined style.

## Properties

### Text

Content which will be presented as uppercased with center text alignment.

## Accessibility

The `Tag` is responsive to dynamic type changes so its internal label will increase/decrease the whole component when that value changes.

## Styles

`Tag` should be configured with a certain style. The style will only change the background and foreground color of the `Tag`.
The `Tag` style name matches the background color.
